\title{Organizing the Megakaryocytes and nuclei together and label}
\usage{
labind(nucleiraw, megaraw, Type = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{nucleiraw}{the nuclei raw data}

\item{megaraw}{the megakaryocytes raw data}
}
\value{
A list contains: 1. labeled and binded raw data; 2. labeled data with the megakaryocytes coount percentage of each group;
3. labeled data with the megakaryocytes area percentage of each group;
}
\description{
This function is used to transform the raw data read from last step into well organized and labeled data.
And also calculating the percentage of megakaryocytes number and area propotion for further analyze.

And also calculating the percentage of megakaryocytes number and area propotion for further analyze.
This function will return us a list contains 1. labeled and binded raw data; 2. labeled data with the megakaryocytes count percentage of each group;
3. labeled data with the megakaryocytes area percentage of each group;
